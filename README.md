# Desafio 2Sow

![Desafio 2Sow ](/public/2Sow.png)

## About The Project

The challenge was to build a system for user registration. I created a home, login, signup, users, create user and edit user screens. The site is responsive from 414px up.

### Built With:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [ReactJS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) - Uma biblioteca JavaScript para criar interfaces de usuário.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress.
